# Innovating with Breakout

Create a small gameplay prototype based on Breakout.

Here are some things to keep in mind:
- try to make your prototype as engaging as possible
- your prototype should be arranged to explore and demonstrate the new gameplay features - you added (i.e. design levels that show your game in its best light)
- focus on gameplay rather than story or visual effects
- use abstract visuals (primitive shapes)
- think small!

In class, be prepared to: 
- playtest your game with your classmates
- answer the question "What is you prototype testing?"
- be prepared to receive critical feedback from your classmates
- share something interesting you learned about or used in order to make your prototype (share technical knowledge)

## Submission

Build your prototype for "Web" and save it as `breakout` inside of the `builds` folder.

Your game should be playble online by going to the following link:

```
http://<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>.github.io/game-dev-spring2025/builds/breakout
```

If you need help getting your project on github, please refer to [these instructions](./setup.html). Most importantly, make sure to add the `.gitignore` file to your Unity project (if you are uploading your Unity project).
