Before we begin prototyping platformer mechanics, spend some time analyzing the differences between **3 platformer games** made before 1995. To find games, use google or whatever, but if you have trouble, choose from popular franchises like Super Mario or Sonic the Hedgehog. If you can play the games yourself, that is best, but if you don't have access, look on youtube search for the game's title and 'longplay' (e.g. "Mega Man X longplay").

For each game, address the following points:

- Describe the movement on the ground (pay attention to the details)
- Describe the jump (again, be detail oriented)
- How has the game's level design been influenced by these movement and jump mechanics?
- Include a screenshot of the game

Your analysis should be written as a file written in the [markdown format](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/markdown-cheatsheet) titled `analysis.md` and it should be located in the following directory: `game-dev-spring2025/prototypes/platformer/`. Include at least a couple paragraphs per game.

Come to class prepared to discuss your analysis to the class. Your analysis should be posted before class at the following:

```

## Platformer Controls - Round 1

*Due: 2-26-25*

Create a 2d or 3d platformer prototype that implements features [from this list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RUum3ofbaDgzheoHGNz9Vk3W7qummd1S33_1BpcjhP4/edit?usp=sharing). Each item on the list has a suggested *"Implementation Difficulty Score"*. Make sure whatever you create adds up to a total of 3. Note that there is no score for basic platforming (moving and jumping). Feel free to start from this [code example](https://github.com/mtreanor/game615-spring2025/tree/main/examples/platformer/Assets/PlatformerPlayerController.cs).

Your prototype should have a small level that demonstrates the mechanics you implemented. Remember to primarily focus on your game mechanics (and not the visuals or effects).

Your game should be playable at the following link:

Fundamentally, platformers involve: getting good at controlling the player's movement, collecting things, defeating enemies, exploring and finding secret locations. For this prototype, take your platformer controls (either from last week, or new ones), and create a collection of challenges/activities.

As you design your prototype, you should have answers to the following questions:

- *Does your game have something to get good at? What is it?*
- *Have you made it interesting to defeat enemies in your game? How?*
- *Does your game involve collecting stuff? How have you made this a satisfying thing to do?*
- *Can you make the player feel clever when making a discovery?*

Your game should be playable at the following link:
