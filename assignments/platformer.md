Before we begin prototyping platformer mechanics, spend some time analyzing the differences between **4 platformer games** (2d or 3d). For each game, address the following points:

- Describe the movement on the ground (pay attention to the details)
- Describe the jump (again, be detail oriented)
- How has the game's level design been influenced by these movement and jump mechanics?
- Include a screenshot of the game

Your analysis should be written as a file written in the [markdown format](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/markdown-cheatsheet) titled `analysis.md` and it should be located in the following directory: `game-dev-spring2025/prototypes/platformer/`. Include at least a couple paragraphs per game.

Come to class prepared to discuss your analysis to the class. Your analysis should be posted before class at the following:
