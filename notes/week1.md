# Week 1: 1-15-25

## Class Structure

- Studio course: a hands-on, project-based course that encourages creativity and experimentation.
    - Less than half lecture - mostly group work and individual feedback
- ~10 hours/week outside of class for prototype design and creation
- You will make 4-5 prototypes in familiar genres (3-4 weeks per prototype)
- Gameplay focused (little focus on visuals, or story)
- Weekly crititue

## Concepts

- Prototyping:
    - Have an idea? Test it out?
        - Try to find new mechanics!
    - Abstraction
    - Prove (disprove) that your mechanic is interesting
    - It can ALWAYS be "better" (more unique, more engaging, more intentional, "leaner"/optimized, etc.)
    - Visual style doesn't matter, as long as your "programmer art" doesn't get in the way of understanding your gameplay
    - Constraints are good! They promote exploration and novelty
- For example, minimalist game design
    - small rulesets
    - narrow decision spaces
    - abstract audiovisual representations
